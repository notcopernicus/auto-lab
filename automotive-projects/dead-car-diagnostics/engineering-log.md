# 2012 Ford Focus

My beautiful bright red car is fully dead and it's time to pop open the hood.

#### 6/20 Day 1 – Battery Inspection
Today, I put the key into the ignition and noticed that I got absolutely no feedback on the dashboard. This prompted me to firstly check out the battery. After removing the battery covers I noticed alot of corrosion and rust plaguing:

> 1. The nuts and bolts
> 2. The positive & negative terminals
> 3. The battery tray
 
So I decided to take a further look and removed the battery. A prominent amount of green corrosion exposed itself, perhaps due to moisture, dirt and debris over the years. I created a baking soda and water solution to thoroughly clean and rinse all parts. The scorching July sun sped up the drying process.

**Tools**
> 10mm wrench
> Wire brush

Looking forward, I plan to re-install all parts and jump start the battery. I also intend to create mini battery telemetry system via Raspberry Pi to explore the electricity factors at play (voltage, cells, temp)


#### 08.02 – Further Thoughts

The battery is indeed dead after further testing. More work needs to be done in terms of identifying what other parts of the car are also faulty.

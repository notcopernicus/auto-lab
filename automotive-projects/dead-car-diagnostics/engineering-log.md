# 2012 Ford Focus

My beautiful bright red car is fully dead and it's time to pop open the hood.

#### 6/20 Day 1 – Battery Inspection
Today, I put the key into the ignition and noticed that I got absolutely no feedback on the dashboard. This prompted me to firstly check out the battery. After removing the battery covers I noticed alot of corrosion and rust plaguing:

> 1. The nuts and bolts
> 2. The positive & negative terminals
> 3. The battery tray
 
So I decided to take a further look and removed the battery. A prominent amount of green corrosion exposed itself, perhaps due to moisture, dirt and debris over the years. I created a baking soda and water solution to thoroughly clean and rinse all parts. The scorching July sun sped up the drying process.

**Tools**
> 10mm wrench
> Wire brush

Looking forward, I plan to re-install all parts and jump start the battery. I also intend to create mini battery telemetry system via Raspberry Pi to explore the electricity factors at play (voltage, cells, temp)


#### 08.02 – Further Thoughts

The battery is indeed dead after further testing. More work needs to be done in terms of identifying what other parts of the car are also faulty.

#### 08.11 – New Insights

Finally, after having a bit of free time, I was able to investigate further into the state of the car. The night that it broke down I noticed that it was leaking a lot of coolant. It is worth noting that the car also some coolant issues before hand. Thus I believe that it will need to undergo coolant testing.

Today, instead of a pressurized coolant test I performed just a simple waterbed test and I was able to pinpoint the exact location of the leak. Minor, but mighty at the clamp, this will definetly need to be tigthened to prevent further leaks.

I believe that it is the lower radiator hose that will need replacing. Additionally, the engine needs to undergo testing to ensure there arent any severe issues due to overheating (eg Blown Head Gasket, or 
cracked block). Once the leak is repaired the temperature of the vehicle can be reviewed to commence the process of further work.

To check the temperature I will need to jumps start the vehicle again since I concluded that the battery was fully dead. Hopefully there isn't major damage to the engine!

#### 08.12 – Research

I hope that there wasn't too much damage made internally to the engine due to overheating and it's just a leaking problem. However, after researching it seems I will need a few materials for this repair:

1. New lower Radiator Hose
2. New clamps
3. Coolant
4. Tools (Screwdriver)

Specifics vary, but these four things are most crucial. It doesn't seem like a job that is extremely hard and im loving the process of learning new things about my vehicle. 

For example, the purpose of a radiator in a vehicle is to dissapate coolant throughput it's fins to release heat and circulate cool air correctly. It sorta looks like an air filter as well lol.

The total cost for this repair is pretty cheap accoridng to AutoZone, and I will attempt to gather them soon, let X represent the aggregate.


> X < 100$

#### 08.14 – More Research

So AutoZone offers a wide array of services that make fixing vehicles cost efficient. I just learned that we may not need a new battery and I can simply just bring it to AutoZone to re-charge it. Today, I am planning to head there if I can and find out more information regarding borrowing a jack stand so I can work under the car. Additionally, she needs a wash because she's so dirty lol!

#### 08.16 — Extended 

So I gave her a nice wash and her bright red color is popping again. I took out the air filter and the battery so I can have access to the leak in the clamp. The actualy hose is fine after testing it was just not secured properly with a clamp. So the vehicle will need a new clamp to tighten the lower radiator down. After replacing the clamp the car will need some coolant so it can transmute and regulate temperature. Additionally, the battery will need to be charged so that the car has electric power.

I think those are the two main internal culprits that need fixing. Hopefully, god willing, there are no other issues inside of the engine that will prove to be fatal. It seems like an easy fix and if the mechanic believed that the car is fully gone he was lying or im just pretentious!

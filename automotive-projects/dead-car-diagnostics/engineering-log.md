# 2012 Ford Focus

My beautiful bright red car is fully dead and it's time to pop open the hood.

#### 6/20 Day 1 – Battery Inspection
Today, I put the key into the ignition and noticed that I got absolutely no feedback on the dashboard. This prompted me to firstly check out the battery. After removing the battery covers I noticed alot of corrosion and rust plaguing:

> 1. The nuts and bolts
> 2. The positive & negative terminals
> 3. The battery tray
 
So I decided to take a further look and removed the battery. A prominent amount of green corrosion exposed itself, perhaps due to moisture, dirt and debris over the years. I created a baking soda and water solution to thoroughly clean and rinse all parts. The scorching July sun sped up the drying process.

> 10mm wrench
> Wire brush

Looking forward, I plan to re-install all parts and jump start the battery. I also intend to create mini battery telemetry system via Raspberry Pi to explore the electricity factors at play (voltage, cells, temp)


#### 08.02 – Further Thoughts

The battery is indeed dead after further testing. More work needs to be done in terms of identifying what other parts of the car are also faulty.

#### 08.11 – New Insights

Finally, after having a bit of free time, I was able to investigate further into the state of the car. The night that it broke down I noticed that it was leaking a lot of coolant. It is worth noting that the car also some coolant issues before hand. Thus I believe that it will need to undergo coolant testing.

Today, instead of a pressurized coolant test I performed just a simple waterbed test and I was able to pinpoint the exact location of the leak. Minor, but mighty at the clamp, this will definetly need to be tigthened to prevent further leaks.

I believe that it is the lower radiator hose that will need replacing. Additionally, the engine needs to undergo testing to ensure there arent any severe issues due to overheating (eg Blown Head Gasket, or 
cracked block). Once the leak is repaired the temperature of the vehicle can be reviewed to commence the process of further work.

To check the temperature I will need to jumps start the vehicle again since I concluded that the battery was fully dead. Hopefully there isn't major damage to the engine!
